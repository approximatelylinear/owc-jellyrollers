## For developers

**To submit a plugin for deployment:**  
Create a feature branch with your ticket number and plugin name (`/feature/45/SimpleGallery`). Add your plugin to the list in [External Dependencies](#external). Be sure to include your implementation and configuration details (how did you set it up?). Create a pull request on that branch.  The *only* change on this plugin deployment branch should be the README updates.
